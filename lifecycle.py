"""Surviving a redeploy without anybody noticing.

Pushing an update to a bot on a platform like Railway means the running
container is replaced. Four separate things go wrong in that gap, and only
one of them is the obvious one:

  1. **Two bots, one token.** If the new container starts polling before the
     old one has stopped, Telegram answers one of them with 409 Conflict and
     both flap. `hold_the_lease()` below settles it with a Postgres advisory
     lock: exactly one process at a time holds the right to poll, and the
     new one waits for the old one's grip to relax rather than fighting it.

  2. **Everything the bot was in the middle of is forgotten.** user_data and
     every ConversationHandler state live in that process's memory and go
     with it. Someone who was three stickers into a pack sends the fourth
     and gets "I don't recognize that" from a bot that, thirty seconds ago,
     knew exactly what they were doing. `PostgresPersistence` writes both
     into the bot's own schema, so the new process picks the conversation up
     mid-sentence.

  3. **Work in flight is killed.** An ffmpeg encode or a download that is
     running when the platform sends SIGTERM does not come back, and the
     user is left looking at "converting..." forever. `busy()` marks those
     stretches; when a stop signal arrives, everyone inside one is told, in
     their own chat, that an update interrupted them -- once, immediately,
     instead of never.

  4. **The owner gets paged for a deploy they did on purpose.** ParentBot
     decides a bot is down from a stale heartbeat, and a redeploy makes
     every heartbeat stale. `mark_expected_restart()` leaves a note in the
     shared database saying this one was deliberate.

What is *not* a problem, and does not need solving: updates sent while the
bot is between containers. Telegram queues undelivered updates for 24 hours
and hands them over on the next getUpdates, so as long as nothing calls
run_polling(drop_pending_updates=True), the gap costs those users latency
and nothing else.

Copied byte-identically into every bot, like shared_features.py,
family_link.py and live_message.py.

# Sections 1-4 are about a redeploy nobody was warned about. This one is for
# the deploy you know is coming: the owner puts a bot into maintenance from
# ParentBot, and until they say otherwise it declines to *start* anything a
# restart would throw away, says roughly how long it expects to be, and
# writes down who it turned away so they can be told when it is over.
#
# Three properties, none of which a module-level flag would have:
#
#   It has to survive the restart it is announcing. One update is often
#   several deploys, so the flag lives in family.settings and is read back at
#   startup rather than being held in the process that is about to end.
#
#   It has to be free to check. Every incoming message asks "are we paused?",
#   so the answer is a cached flag -- set at startup and whenever ParentBot
#   says so -- and not a query per update.
#
#   The people turned away have to outlive the process too. That is what
#   family.update_waitlist is: one row per person told to come back, removed
#   when they are told they can.
#
# The announced time is an estimate and nothing more. Maintenance ends when
# the owner ends it, never on a timer -- because the reason they wanted a
# manual end is exactly that one update can take several deploys, and a timer
# would let the bot reopen between two of them. Once the estimate has passed
# the bots stop quoting a number rather than start quoting a wrong one.
