"""One bot message that keeps evolving -- for as long as it is still the
last thing in the chat.

Editing a message in place is the right shape for anything that changes:
a menu the user is walking through, a "converting..." that becomes
"added", a pack status line that counts up. It is how fstik and BotFather
read, and it beats a fresh message per step.

It has one failure mode, and it is invisible from the bot's side. The edit
lands wherever that message already is. If the user has typed anything
since -- another photo, "ok", a stray sticker -- the message being edited
is no longer at the bottom of the chat, so the user is looking at their own
message while the bot silently rewrites something above it. On a phone that
is off-screen. The bot answered; nobody saw it.

So every evolving message here carries a watermark: the id of the newest
message the *user* had sent in that chat at the moment the bot last wrote
it. Before each edit that watermark is compared with what has arrived
since:

  nothing new        -> edit in place, exactly as before
  the user spoke     -> send a new message, and evolve that one from now on

Only the user's own messages count. A button tap does not (the message they
tapped *is* the live one), and neither does the bot's own chatter -- except
where a bot deliberately sends something underneath a live message, which
is what bump() is for.

The watermark lives in this module, keyed by chat, in a bounded dict. It is
deliberately not persisted: a process that has just started has no idea what
the chat looks like, and the safe assumption there is "something happened
while I was away", which is what an empty watermark already means -- the
first write after a restart sends a new message instead of editing a message
the user may have scrolled far past. save()/restore() carry the *handle*
across a restart (see lifecycle.py), not the watermark.

This file is copied byte-identically into every bot, like shared_features.py
and family_link.py -- each bot is its own repo and its own deployment, so
nothing is imported across folders.
