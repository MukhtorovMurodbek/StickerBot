"""Small self-contained features used by this bot -- kept in one file for
convenience. It is copied byte-identically into every bot rather than
imported across folders, because each bot is its own repo and its own
deployment -- the same arrangement family_link.py uses. Nothing here
touches another bot's data: the cross-bot machinery all lives in
family_link.py. Things that live here:
  1. Sibling-bot cross-promotion text/buttons, for /start and /help --
     purely cosmetic (one env var), no database involved. Plus the one-tap
     language picker /start shows, which every bot renders the same way.
  2. A throttled, non-annoying donation reminder + a self-serve /donate
     command paid in Telegram Stars (no external payment processor needed).
  3. /privacy, /terms and /deletemydata: what this bot keeps on somebody,
     who else gets to see it, and the command that erases it again.
  4. The shared half of /cancel: the states this file can leave a user
     waiting in, the release of Telegram's client-side reply lock, and the
     one report format every bot's /cancel answers in.
  5. Logging setup, unhandled-exception tracking, active-user tracking, and
     hosting-environment detection, all in support of each bot's owner-only
     /status command.
  6. attach_maintenance()/flush_on_shutdown(): the jobs that keep a
     long-running process cheap -- writing buffered activity counts out in
     batches instead of a row per update, and dropping the cached per-user
     state of people who stopped using the bot months ago.
  7. attach_flood_gate(): a ceiling on what one person can make the bot do
     per minute, applied before any handler runs.

# What one person is allowed to cost
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Telegram rate-limits what a bot SENDS and nothing at all about what it
# receives, so until now one script could hold a container and a shared
# database busy for as long as it liked: /stats in a loop is a query each, a
# link pasted into DownloaderBot is a fetch and an encode, and an inbox link
# is meant to be posted somewhere public, which is where the traffic that
# does this comes from.
#
# The ceiling is per user and deliberately high -- a fast typist, an album,
# and a run of button taps all have to pass -- because what it is defending
# against is a loop, not a hurry.
#
# Two properties matter as much as the number:
#
#   It runs BEFORE any handler, so a refused update costs one dictionary
#   lookup rather than a database round trip. A limit checked inside the
#   handler has already paid for the thing it was meant to prevent.
#
#   It answers once and then goes quiet. A gate that replies to every
#   refused message turns an incoming flood into an outgoing one, which is
#   worse: the sender pays nothing and the bot pays Telegram's send budget
#   for every other user in the queue.
#
# In memory rather than in the database on purpose, for the same reason
# AnonBot's own limiter is: one container holds the polling lease, so there
# is exactly one counter, and paying a round trip to enforce a per-minute
# limit would cost more than the limit saves. A redeploy forgets it, and the
# worst that costs is one burst getting through after a restart.

# Donation reminder + /donate (Telegram Stars)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cadence: usage only, on a schedule that runs out.
#
# Each bot decides what counts as an "action" -- a finished pack, a completed
# conversion, a delivered download -- and calls maybe_donation_nudge() at
# that point. DONATION_STEPS is how many further actions are needed before
# each successive nudge: the first at 15, the second 60 after that, the third
# 200 after that, and then never again.
#
# What this replaced, and why (v1.2.3):
#
#   The old rule was "20 actions OR 14 days since the last nudge", floored at
#   3 days. The time half was the problem. It fired on people who were barely
#   using the bot -- the ones least likely to pay for it and most likely to
#   read a fortnightly reminder as spam -- and it never stopped, so a user of
#   three years who had already decided not to donate would be asked around
#   seventy times. An ask that repeats forever is not an ask, it is a tax on
#   being a regular.
#
#   Usage-only fixes the first half: the nudge now only ever arrives right
#   after the bot has just done something useful, which is the one moment it
#   has earned the right to ask. The schedule fixes the second: someone who
#   has been asked three times across 275 successful actions and has not
#   given has answered the question, and continuing to ask only costs
#   goodwill.
#
# The counters live in THIS bot's own schema -- the five bots share one
# database but never each other's tables -- so somebody active in two bots
# may be asked by each. That is an accepted tradeoff and it is bounded now,
# because each bot asks at most three times ever.
#
# Anyone with a paid row in star_transactions is never nudged again by that
# bot. Thanking somebody for donating by asking them to donate is the worst
# sentence this file could produce.

# ---- pinning the nudge instead of repeating it (off by default) ----
# The owner proposed pinning the prompt in the chat so it stays visible
# without being re-sent. The instinct is right -- "ask once, remain visible"
# beats "ask again" -- and the implementation is here, but it is off, for
# three reasons worth reading before turning it on:
#
#   A pin is a permanent claim on the top of the user's chat window, for
#   something explicitly voluntary. The nudge's own text ends "no pressure
#   either way", and a pinned ask contradicts it.
#
#   Pinning posts a service message into the chat ("… pinned a message"),
#   so the thing meant to avoid a second notification creates one. Pinning
#   silently avoids the alert but not the service message.
#
#   It competes with the bot's real uses of the chat header. Nothing pins
#   today, but the first genuinely useful thing to pin -- a maintenance
#   notice, a sticker pack link -- would be arguing with a tip jar.
#
# With the schedule above capping the ask at three times ever, the problem
# pinning was meant to solve is mostly already solved. If you want it anyway:
# DONATION_PIN=on. It pins the nudge silently, unpins the previous one first,
# and unpins for good the moment that person donates.

#

#   can believe they paid;
#   it logs a warning at import, so a production process that somehow had it
#   set would say so in the first line of its log rather than silently

#   the description -- up to 512 characters, and the whole of what an empty
#   chat shows above the Start button, under "What can this bot do?".
#
# Both were blank, so an empty chat said nothing at all and search results
# showed a name and a username. Both take a language_code, so all three
# languages go up, and the English text goes up twice: once tagged "en" and
# once untagged, because the untagged one is what Telegram falls back to for
# somebody whose client is in German.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The slash menu, twice
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every bot in the family handles commands it never offers. The owner-only
# ones -- /status, /dbdump, /messageas and each bot's own -- were kept out of
# set_my_commands on the sound reasoning that there is no point advertising to
# a stranger a command they cannot run. The unsound part was that this also
# hid them from the one person who can: the owner types /status into their own
# bot from memory, or does not, and a command nobody remembers is a command
# that may as well not exist.
#
# Telegram already has the answer and the family was not using it. A command
# menu has a *scope*, and BotCommandScopeChat sets one for a single chat.
# So the menu goes up twice: the public list at the default scope, which is
# what everybody sees, and the public list plus the owner-only ones in each
# admin's own chat with the bot. Nobody else's menu changes, and the guards
# are untouched -- a scope decides what is offered, never what is allowed.
#
# Two things are worth knowing about scopes:
#
#   A scoped menu outlives the reason for it. Drop an id from *_ADMIN_ID and
#   that person keeps the longer menu until somebody calls delete_my_commands
#   for their chat. It is cosmetic -- every one of those commands still checks
#   _is_admin and still refuses them -- but it is why the menu is not a
#   permission.
#   set_my_commands for a chat Telegram has never seen fails. An admin who has
#   never opened their own bot is exactly that chat, so this never raises: a
#   cosmetic call is not a reason to fail a deploy, same as publish_profile.
#
# AND IN THREE LANGUAGES, SINCE v1.6.0
# The bots answer in English, Uzbek and Russian everywhere except the one list
# somebody reads before they have understood anything. A menu also takes a
# language_code -- the same way publish_profile() already sends the profile
# text three times -- and Telegram picks the list matching the client's own
# language, falling back to the untagged one.
#
# So English lives in each bot's BOT_COMMANDS, where the menu can be read by
# reading bot.py, and the other two live in i18n.COMMAND_MENU keyed by command
# name. A command with no translation keeps its English description rather
# than disappearing from that language's menu, which is the one failure mode
# worth designing against: a half-translated menu is missing commands, and a
# missing command looks like a bot that cannot do the thing.
#
# Four commands are deliberately NOT translated, and they are the four that
# look most like they should be. /en, /uz and /rus are each described in the
# language they switch *to*, and /language is described in all three at once.
# A per-language menu does not change that: somebody whose client is Russian
# but who wants Uzbek has to recognise "O'zbekchaga o'tish", and somebody who
# set the wrong language needs /language to be legible whatever the menu is
# currently in. They are the way back, so they are written for everyone.
#
# The owner's scoped menu stays untagged English. All admin output in this
# family is English by policy, and the owner is the one reader whose language
# is not in question.

# How a long message is laid out
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Telegram gives a bot four things to design with: bold, a monospace run, an
# expandable blockquote, and blank lines. That is the whole palette, and it is
# enough -- what it is not is automatic, and until this existed every screen in
# the family was one undifferentiated column of sentences. /privacy was the
# worst of them at about two thousand characters, which on a phone is four
# thumb-flicks of unbroken grey.
#
# The rules, such as they are:
#
#   A title line, once, at the top: the subject in bold, with the emoji that
#   the string already carries. Telegram has no heading levels -- there is
#   bold and there is not-bold -- so the title and the section headings use
#   the same helper and are told apart by position.
#   Section headings in bold, with a blank line above and none below.
#   Anything longer than a short paragraph goes in an expandable blockquote,
#   so the shape of the message is visible without scrolling and the detail is
#   one tap away.
#   Commands in a monospace run, so /deletemydata reads as a thing to type
#   rather than as a word in a sentence.
#
# EVERYTHING INTERPOLATED IS ESCAPED. The text these wrap comes from i18n.py
# and is written by whoever translated it; a stray "<" in a Russian string
# would otherwise take the whole message down with "can't parse entities", and
# the failure lands on the user as silence rather than as a log line.

# A link in a notice should not drag a preview card in behind it: the card
# for a GitHub page is a screenful of nothing under a document that is already
# long. Same call downloader_bot/bot.py makes.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A Telegram bot has no cookie banner, no tracking pixel and no third-party
# embeds, so most of a website's compliance checklist does not apply to one.
# What does apply is the part underneath: a bot holds personal data from the
# first message, because a numeric Telegram user id is the only thing it can
# address a person by, and it cannot ask permission before receiving one.
#
# Telegram asks every bot for a privacy policy and gives BotFather a field to
# put the link in, so there has to be something to link to. Three commands
# rather than one document nobody opens:
#
#   /privacy       what this bot keeps, who else sees it, how long it stays
#   /terms         what the bot may be used for, and where the money stands
#   /deletemydata  the erase button that makes the other two mean something
#
# A policy is worth what it can be held to, which is why the third command
# exists. Without it the first two describe a filing cabinet nobody can open.
#
# The wording is per-bot on purpose. StickerBot keeps sticker packs, AnonBot
# keeps who is talking to whom, DownloaderBot hands a link to somebody else's
# server -- a policy describing "the bot" in the abstract describes none of
# them truthfully. So this file owns the shape and the handlers, and each
# bot's i18n.py owns two keys: "privacy_stored", the list of what it actually
# keeps, and "privacy_others", whoever outside the family it has to talk to.
# The long forms live in PRIVACY.md and TERMS.md in each bot's repository.

# Who is running this copy, and how to reach them. A privacy notice that
# cannot name someone to complain to is a notice about nobody. Left blank the
# commands still work and omit the line, which is the honest result for a
# local test instance -- better than printing an address that goes nowhere.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every bot has at least one state where it has asked a question and is now
# sitting there waiting for the answer, and until this existed there was no
# single way out of them.
#
# /cancel asks before it does anything. A bot juggling a pack, a conversion
# and a donation prompt at once had one /cancel that stopped all three, and
# no way to say which one you meant -- so the command that exists to undo a
# mistake was itself the mistake, if what you wanted was to abandon the pack
# and keep the conversion. It now offers one button per waiting thing, plus
# "everything" when there is more than one and "keep going" always. Nothing
# is stopped until a button is tapped.
#
# The exception, and it is the common case, is having nothing to cancel:
# with no pending state there is nothing to ask about, so /cancel answers
# straight away exactly as it always did.
#
# Each bot builds its own /cancel out of the pieces below: cancel_items()
# for the states this file owns, cancel_question() and the *_choice helpers
# for the asking, release_force_reply() for Telegram's client-side reply
# lock, and build_cancel_text() so all of them report back in the same
# shape. Reporting *what* was stopped is the point, not decoration.

    bot, or even the database, releases it -- which is how a "how many Stars
    would you like to donate?" prompt can still be demanding an answer two
    days and several redeployments later. Deleting the prompt is the only
    lever a bot actually has.

    Two ways to find it, because the first stops working the moment the

      1. the id remember_force_reply() stored when we sent it, and
      2. the message this /cancel is itself a reply to -- which is exactly

         looking at when they typed it.

    stored_only turns (2) off, for the button path: there, the message being
    "replied to" is the bot's own "which one?" question, whose reply target
    is the user's /cancel. Deleting that would be deleting the wrong message
    entirely -- theirs. ask_cancel_choice stores the id under (1) before the
    question goes out, so nothing is lost by ignoring (2) here.

    Best-effort throughout. Telegram only lets a bot delete messages under
    48 hours old, so an old enough prompt cannot be removed at all; that is
    what the ReplyKeyboardRemove in build_cancel_text()'s caller is for, as

# Every message that ends in a known code is logged with its time, code and a
# fresh incident id. The problems worth reporting also get a Report row beside
# whatever buttons they already had, carrying that same incident, so a report
# and its log line meet. The owner, about a Report button under "I don't
# recognize that command": "not every command needs a report button. But keep
# the report itself. Every exception should be logged inside the bot
# automatically with time and id, but this one is simple." Which problems are
# simple is problems.SIMPLE.

# A report sends nothing personal, and the disclaimer before it says exactly
# what it does send. It is stored in the shared database and messaged to the
# owner's account; if the owner has never started this bot, it is raised as a
