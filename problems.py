"""Every problem a person can run into in the family's bots, by code.

The owner asked for this in so many words: "Give every possible exception that
the user might trigger a code or a unique identifier", a "report the issue"
button beside it, and "a list or a dictionary that can decode this error
message with as much accuracy as possible." This file is that dictionary.

A CODE names a kind of problem and never changes once shipped, so a report
sent months later still decodes. An INCIDENT names one occurrence: it is made
when the message goes out, carried by the report button, and written to the
log beside what happened, so a report can be matched to its log line.

A code is shown at the end of a message as "🆔 CODE". i18n.t() appends that
line for every key in KEYS; a message assembled from several strings gets it
at its end, where it is assembled (ConvertBot's job endings, StickerBot's
sticker errors and imports, DownloaderBot's allowance message).
shared_features logs every message that ends in one, with its time and incident,
and puts a report button under the ones that are not SIMPLE.

Copied, not imported, into all five bots -- ManagerBot's /decode reads it.
Pure: no Telegram, no database, nothing that can fail at import.
